## About Me
My biggest strength is that I love learning, especially learning new things. I studied in different directions at the university related to philology. Now I am studying on the online program from the university at the Faculty of Applied Technology. But the university program does not provide many important applied knowledge, so these courses are a great help to me in learning Web Development.
